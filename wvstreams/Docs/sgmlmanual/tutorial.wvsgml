 WVPARTINTRO(A WvStreams Tutorial,

  In this part, we dive quickly into some example programs that will give
  you a feel for the concepts behind WvStreams before you need to deal with
  all the gory details.  We'll show you how to compile your own
  applications, then we'll write a network client and server, and
  demonstrate how to read and write some config files.

  In later chapters, we'll go into more detail about the techniques used to
  write these programs, and why they really work.  For now, just try out the
  programs as we present them and think about how the different parts might
  fit together.
