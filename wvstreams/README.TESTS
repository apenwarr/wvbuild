Note that the unit tests (invoked through 'make test') will fail if WvStreams 
is linked against the default version of OpenSSL 0.9.8. To get around this, 
you need to use a version of OpenSSL built with the PURIFY define enabled 
(-DPURIFY).

Instructions on doing this (working as of Tuesday January 16 2006 with
OpenSSL 0.9.8d):
- Build SSL seperately.
 - ./Configure -DPURIFY -shared linux-elf
 - make
- Set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable so your version of OpenSSL
 is used (instead of the system one). 
 - export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PATH_TO_OPENSSL:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- Configure WvStreams to use the version of OpenSSL you built
 - ./configure --with-openssl=$PATH_TO_OPENSSL ...
