Package: libwvstreams4.4-base
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 WvStreams is a library suite that is comprised of several parts.  Included
 in the base package are:
  * WvString: a convenient and efficient C++ string class
  * WvList: an easy-to-use linked list
  * WvHashTable: an efficient and easy-to-use hash table
  * WvFile: a WvStream wrapper for handling files
  * WvStreamClone: a base class which makes writing your own WvStreams easy
  * WvLog: a log files handler 
  * UniIniGen: a tiny version of UniConf for simple configuration systems

Package: libwvstreams4.4-extras
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 WvStreams is a library suite that is comprised of several parts.  Included
 in the extras package are:
  * WvIPStreams: which includes WvTCPStream and WvUDPStream
  * WvCrypto streams: a REALLY easy way to add SSL support to applications 
 .
 These are the base classes used to build programs such as the ever popular 
 WvDial, TunnelVision, FastForward, KWvDial, retchmail, and many more yet 
 to come.  ;) 

Package: libuniconf4.4
Architecture: any
Section: libs
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Conflicts: libuniconf4.0 (<< 4.0.2-5)
Description: C++ network libraries for rapid application development
 UniConf is a configuration system that can serve as the centrepiece among
 many other, existing configuration systems, such as:
  * GConf
  * KConfig
  * Windows registry
  * Mutt ;)
 .
 UniConf can also be accessed over the network, with authentication, allowing
 easy replication of configuration data via the UniReplicateGen.
