/**
 * A lightwight but slightly dangerous variant of UniCacheGen.
 * 
 * UniCacheGen tries to make all operations asynchronous, by storing a local
 * cache of absolutely everything in the entire UniConf subtree that it wraps.
 * UniFastRegetGen, on the other hand, tries to be helpful without actually
 * wasting too much memory, but leaves many operations still synchronous.
 * 
 * This is useful for programs that may need to access a variety of different
 * UniConf keys, don't need to worry *too* much about blocking occasionally
 * while waiting for UniConf, but would like most get() operations to be
 * fast.
 * 
 * UniFastRegetGen makes subsequent get() operations on a key, after the
 * first one, be guaranteed asynchronous.  It caches keys which you've
 * previously done get() on, and accepts notifications for those keys
 * (so the value is always up to date, but you'll never have to wait for it
 * again).  It makes no attempt to optimize any other operations, including
 * set(), refresh/commit, or iterate.  It ignores notifications for any
 * keys you haven't explicitly done get() on in the past.
