/**
 * WvBufStream stores data written by write(), and returns it
 * later on in read().
 * 
 * Handy for making virtual streams, like WvHttpPool.
 * 
 * After seteof(), the stream closes itself (without error) once the inbuf
 * is emptied out by read().
 * 
 * FIXME: WvStream itself should probably deal better with streams that go
 * !isok() with stuff still in inbuf.  Then we could skip seteof() altogether,
 * and just do close() when we're done write()ing data.  For now, it's just
 * too unreliable to do that, since streams do things like drop out of
 * WvStreamLists automatically when they're !isok(), even if they still have
 * data in inbuf.
 * 
 * 2003/12/09: This is cleaned up a lot by WvStream's new noread()/nowrite()
 * functions, but we still need to actually *use* them in WvBufStream...
