This branch can be used for building wvstreams for win32 using a mingw32
cross compiler on Debian or Ubuntu.  I realize that's a bit convoluted, but
it works well enough for now.

We use only static libraries, not dynamic ones, mostly to avoid dealing with
Windows DLL hell.

To build:

	apt-get install mingw32 mingw32-runtime mingw32-binutils ccache
	./configure-mingw32
	make

If you have trouble, send a message to the wvstreams mailing list:
	wvstreams-devel@googlegroups.com
